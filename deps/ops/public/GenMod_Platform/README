For the majority of platforms, to call a C function from Fortran, it must be
declared with a lower case name with a trailing underscore in C. E.g.:

! In Fortran
CALL symbol()

/* In C */
void symbol_() {
    /* do something ... */
}

This problem will become obsolete as we move to Fortran 2003 or above, when we
can use its "Interoperability with C" feature.
